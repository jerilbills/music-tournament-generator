So the upper bound (the most possible groups) is listnum/4, and the lower bound (fewest possible groups) is listnum/8. Because 8 is one power of 2 higher than 4, log2 of listnum/8 will always be 1 less than log2 of listnum/4. converting math.log2(listnum/4) automatically returns the power to which we need to raise 2 in order to get the number of groups, since int will round down to the nearest whole integer, and log2 of listnum/4 is our upper bound.
